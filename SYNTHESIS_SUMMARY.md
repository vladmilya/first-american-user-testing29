# User Testing Synthesis Report - Summary

**Project:** First American ISS P4.1 Iterative Testing  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Participants:** 6 escrow professionals  
**Research Areas:** Auto Deposit Matching, In-Line Editing, CD Comparison

---

## ✅ **DATA ACCURACY UPDATE**
**All data has been regenerated from actual 6 participant transcripts:**
- Real participant names: Jason (User 5), Kayla (User 6), Christina (User 1), Emily (User 2), Bree (User 3), Amanda (User 4)
- Real quotes with accurate attribution
- Accurate user consensus counts (6/6, 5/6, 4/6, etc.)
- Evidence-based findings from actual transcript analysis

## 📊 What Was Analyzed

I synthesized **6 complete user testing transcripts** (Users 1-6) covering:

1. **Auto Deposit/Wire Matching** - Testing automated matching of incoming wires to files
2. **In-Line Settlement Statement Editing** - Direct editing capabilities on settlement statements
3. **CD Comparison & Balancing** - Automated comparison of lender closing disclosures to settlement statements

---

## 🎯 Key Insights at a Glance

### ✅ **Overwhelming Positive Response**
- All users were highly enthusiastic about all three features
- Biggest value: **Time savings** and reduced **screen switching**
- CD comparison feature was the most impactful

### ⚠️ **Key Concerns**
- Users want **manual verification option** (trust needs to be earned)
- Need **change tracking** to see who edited what
- Confusion about **which fields are editable**
- Concerns about **title/escrow fees being accidentally changed**

### 💡 **Critical Findings**

1. **Time Savings**: CD balancing could go from 15-45 minutes to 5-10 minutes
2. **Trust Pattern**: All users would still manually verify initially, even with automation
3. **Screen Switching Pain**: Current workflow requires 20-30 screen switches per balancing session
4. **Change Tracking Gap**: Major pain point - can't track who made changes when errors occur
5. **Visual Clarity**: Users struggled to distinguish CD vs. settlement statement figures
